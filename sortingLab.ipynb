Did you consider the first item of the list to be sorted, then place the next item in the spot where the first item mixed with the next item would continue to be sorted and continue this process until all items in the list were added (Insertion Sort)? Did you look for consecutive sequences of two items in the list that were out of order and swap them if they were out of order (Bubble Sort)? There are a couple more useful sorting algorithms but today we will focus on these three. If you used one of these go back and try the other two approaches. If you used something completely diffrent then try all three and note how they compare."
